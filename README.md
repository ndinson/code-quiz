# code-quiz

## Description

This project is a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice type questions. Users of this application will be able to test their knowledge on basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

Upon starting the quiz, users are prompted with a series of questions. Once the current question is answered, the user is notified whether or not they got it correct and the next question is displayed. For every wrong answer, 10 seconds is deducted off of the timer score. This goes on until either all questions have been answered or if time runs out. When the quiz ends, the user then has the option to save their score. 

## Tasks Completed

- Created an instructions page which includes a Start Quiz Button.
- Created a page to view saved scores.
- Implemented using an array to display the questions and answers.
- Added a countdown function to keep track of the user's time/ score.
- Utilized local storage to save a user's score and have it display until the Clear Scored button is clicked.
